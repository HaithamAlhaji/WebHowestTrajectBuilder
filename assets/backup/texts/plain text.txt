Curriculum builder: the tool for tailored curricula
Studying for a Bachelor's degree can be tough. Not everyone commences studies with the same background, whilst others combine it with a (full-time) job. In order to service all students from all backgrounds, we enable them to create a tailor-made curriculum that suits their needs.

Curricula have to fit like a glove. Study too light, boredom and disinterest will set in. Take on a too loaded approach and you'll succomb to the insurmountable pressure. It is important that each semester is balanced.

This tool allows you to take your pick from available courses and construct a schedule that does not only fit your needs, but respects the order in which certain topics need to be processed. You may take longer or shorter than a standard student depending on your constructed curriculum, but at least you'll be happy
